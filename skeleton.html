            <summary class="description">In Love In Colour, Babalola takes myths, legends and folk tales and transforms them into modern-day romances.<br  >

            But these aren’t race-flipped versions of white, Western narratives: Babalola draws on Yoruba myth and religion, on folk tales told in Lesotho and Ghana, as well as the Ancient Greek myth of Eros and Psyche. 
           <br  >
            “The point is, we don’t need to re-imagine known white stories with Black people and [people of colour],” she has said. “We have our own.”</summary>
